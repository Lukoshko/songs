When you're scared and you don't know where I am, 
you must remember: no matter what happens to me, 
I will never be far away from my special, little Starfire

   C                 F            Am
It always seems more quiet in the dark
    Fm                  C
It always feels so stark
            F               Am
How silence grows under the moon
       Fm                  Am
Consummation's gone so soon
              Fm              E
I used to think that I was bold
            Dm                   Am
I used to think love would be fun
            F                E
Now, all my stories have been told
           F
Except for one
 
 
[Verse 1]
       C                 Em
As the stars start to align
           F              Fm
I hope you take it as a sign
                   C        Fm
That you will be okay
                    C       Fm
Everything will be okay
 
 
[Verse 2]
           C                  Em
And if the seven rings collapse
             F                  Fm
Although the day could be my last
             C         Fm
You will be okay
                           C     Fm
When I'm gone you'll be okay
 
 
[Verse 3]
            C             Em
And when Creation goes to die
        F              Fm
You can find me in the sky
              C         Fm
Upon the last day
                C
And you will be okay...
