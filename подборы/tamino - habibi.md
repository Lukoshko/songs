[Verse 1]
Something hides in every night
Brings desire from the deep
And with it comes a burning light
To keep us from our sleep

[Verse 2]
And as the full star tries his best to make the white pearl shine
Glances of a new day have arrived
And though he’s not alone, he fears to never love another
And leave his heart forever with her smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Haa-aah

[Chorus]
Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
As I am yearning

[Verse 3]
Something died within a soul
Left the eyes to rust
And every time it is recalled
It covers all in dust

[Pre-Chorus]
Haa-aah

[Chorus]
Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
As I am yearning

[Bridge]
And meanwhile, a whole lot goes down
Somewhere in the darkness, us together for a while

You loved it then, so did I
A feeling deep inside you wants to love it all again

^^^^^^
Now don’t leave it there, just give it a chance
If only I’d forget you after one last dance
But you’re everywhere, yes you are
In every melody and in every little scar
Yes you are, you are - love

[Chorus]
Habibi, light is burning
As I am burning
Habibi, light is burning
And I am yearning
