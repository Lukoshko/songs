Hm Em Hm F#
In the morning I was counting stars, yes,
Stars were blank and I want to get there
And i like it
And I want you to see
Morning stars down
1-2-3-5-6-7-8…


        F#   Hm        C#      F#
The morning stars are shining above your head
Em                              Hm
It's me who plays them on the heaven,
Em      F#

He's a liar, he's not what you deserve
And I stay silent coming out of my nerves …
And all the love there
and be somobody else
But my heart's overburdened
Would you go far away become?
You should go there some there wrong back again

I love you as nobody else
You know, the magic can do,
You know, the magic can do,
And all the music can sigh …

/The morning stars are shining above your head

8, 9, 10,

8, 9, 10 ...
My heart’s overburdened …
