No one’s getting (right or wrong??)
……………….under skies???
Everyone is loved and loving
Walking on the wires
Freedom’s just a word today
And everyone complies
All the questions fade away
And answers stealing time (=still in time??)

I have no way
I’m jumbling in this game

They call us the dreamers
But just because we cannot fly
We’re not the sinners
You and I
They call us the dreamers
They call us the sinners

The grass might (be) greener on the side
Which you will never see
Just make a step and close your eyes
And Make your body breathe
If someone takes the sun away
It means you should believe
The sun goes to most everything
That you can ever give

Just burn away
All that you have had

They call us the dreamers
But just because we cannot fly
We’re not the sinners
You and I
They call us the dreamers
They call us the sinners

I’ll find you
I promise
I’ll catch you in this diamond
I won’t stop the screaming
While only one heart’s beating

They call us the dreamers
But just because they cannot fly
We’re not the sinners
You and I
