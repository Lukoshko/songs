F#m                                  Hm       D          F#m
Said the Thief to the Moon, "I'll extinguish your light soon,
            Hm     D       A                           C#                     F#m
I'll put an end to all the light that you shed on this world in its darkened state."


F#m                                Hm          D        F#m
Said the Moon to the Thief, " You know not of what you seek,
       Hm       D        A                        C#                                 F#m
you'll doom the world to wander the night with no light to guide the paths that men seek."




         Hm D    Hm                          F#m
"Oh, but all the wealth in the world will be mine...
          Hm    D  Hm                    F#m
without a means of defense for all those blind.
         Hm D          Hm             F#m
My very existence is a race to attain wealth,
        C#                                                F#m
for the thief's only loyalty in life is to the devil and himself."

F#m A C# F#m (x2)


                Hm          E      Hm           F#m
"The earth will rise up and devour all that you are.
                    Hm    E          Hm           F#m
The skies will call forth thunderous storms from afar.
            Hm             E                Hm          F#m
When you're dead, there'll be no grave to remember your name.
         C#                                                F#m
For your greed brings your end and there's no one but yourself to blame.

you'll doom the world to wander the night with no light to guide the paths that men seek."

*(Do this when transitioning from EM to AM, recommend using your third finger to make
transitioning to the other cord smoother.)

[Chorus 1]
         Am C    Am                          Em
"Oh, but all the wealth in the world will be mine...

without a means of defense for all those blind.

My very existence is a race to attain wealth,
        B                                                Em
for the thief's only loyalty in life is to the devil and himself."



*You can either use the Am C Am chords again, or use the Am D Am configuration here.

The skies will call forth thunderous storms from afar.
