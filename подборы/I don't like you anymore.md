[Verse]
Bm      Em          Bm          Em
I don't like you anymore.
       Bm             Em    Bm          Em
You've fallen for the faux again
  Bm             Em            Bm          Em
Enticed me for a second time today
Bm             Em          Bm          Em
Only for me to realise the same
 
[Chorus]
        Bm
I don't like you anymore
       Em                    C#
You're cracked and your face changing
       Bm
You're going down the old route
    Em                C#              Bm
But I can't let you repeat repeat it again
Bm
The sound of your voice
   Em          C#
Is piercing my patience
      Bm                                 Em          C#
As it seeps on through the midnight corridors



Kindly keeping in your resent
Retire to the setting hate
Drying in an old familiar cast
Twitching as I fear it's far too late
'Cause I don't like you anymore
I don't like you anymore


I don't like you anymore
You're cracked and your face is changing
You're going down the old route
But I can't let you repeat, repeat it again
The sound of your voice
Is piercing my patience
As you turn through the midnight corridors

And there's nothing but corners
There is no escape from these
Walked into your trap and breathed your disease
We're nauseous as if in the seas
And you smirk as you think that you tease
But you pout pushed us about
And your final lie can't be described as fine
Will never be described as fine
