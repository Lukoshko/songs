I'm gonna tell my eyes not to see no colours
Tell my ears not to take no lovers
Keep my head underneath the covers
Keep my eyes on you
I don't need no others

Throw away all my old letters
Sit in the kitchen and trim my feathers
Got a picture of you to replace the sky
If I lose you in a crowd
I'll sit down and cry

Dee dee dee...

Got a tinfoil hat that keeps me from dreaming
Gonna sip my wine and stare at the ceiling
Gonna keep my smiles in the breadbox
Til you get home
Choke them down with water
When you leave me all alone

Gonna tell my eyes not to see no colours
Tell my ears not to take no lovers
Gonna keep my head underneath the covers
Keep my eyes on you I don't need no others

Throw away all my old letters
I'll sit in the kitchen and trim my feathers
Got a picture of you to replace the sky
If I lose you in a crowd

I'll lay down
I'll lay down
I'll lay down
I'll lay down
I'll lay down

And I'll die

I don't need
I don't need
I don't need
I don't need
I don't need no others
