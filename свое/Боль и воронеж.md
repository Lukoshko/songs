A guy. he was seventeen
He got a ticket for-a-bus
It was his big-city-dream
And now he's in Kansas

Oooh, He was going, going that's the way he's going to Kansas



The Guy, he's looking for job, (work)
A fair one, so he met us.
But he met a mob.(jerk)
So I met poor boy in Kansas.

Oooooooh, he met a bad man, met some bad-men, poor he met a bad-man in Kansas!



The Guy, like mo-oth to flame
Flying to the higher-class
He lost that unfair game
That's how-I fooled him in Kansas

Oooooooooh, The boy was fooled-an' robbed-an' fucked-an' lied to in Kansas



The Guy, he's seeking revenge
His only dream to kick my ass.
Your Ho-onor wants to allege.
He tried to find me in Kansas.

Oooooooh, вынюхивал расспрашивал разузновал обо мне в Канзасе



Hey Guy, it was only a prank
But you are pointing gun at us
I-pay-you-back with a shank
And now you dying in Kansas

Oooooooh, the boy was stabbed-an'  killed-an' died-an'  in Kansas

Oooooooh, вввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввв  в Канзасе
