We wanna have no limitations.
But you wanna gain some control. 
I don't have profit from meditation, 
Stil I fuck some random girls. 


my mother calls me "Shameless"
Cause I don't care what you say.  
I (still) dont remember your faces
As I know you are the same


Have you seen how many attention 
You should waste on her empty words? 
Forced to listen to all that frustration #
and her hopes for some greater odds #


my mother calls me "Rotten"
Cause I don't care IF you stay.  
Stil we fly close to bottom
It seems like you are the same


my mother calls me "Shameless"
my mother calls me "Rotten"
my Mother made me Broken.

my mother doesn't call me
my mother doesn't call me (And now I know why )
my mother doesn't call me (My flavour - hex and decay.)
my mother doesn't call me (текст )





It’s the route to my heart you’d like to pave,
That makes me grin but also sad;
you must have to be dickfull brave 
to have life as deep as I have had
